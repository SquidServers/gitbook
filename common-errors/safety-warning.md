**Reason for the pop-up** – The warning appears because the developers of SquidServer's haven't paid for the code signing certificates (~$300 on Windows and $99 on Mac).

If still unsure, feel free to run the program through free virus analyzers such as VirusTotal or test it out in your own Virtual Machine :D
