_Author: Yunus Emre and dkt_

### Selecting Paper

1. Start by creating a new Minecraft server.
2. When asked to choose a type, you’ll see Vanilla, Paper, and Fabric   \
   Select Paper&#x20;
3. When you reach the world configuration step click the Minecraft Version
   1. This will open up a list of all minecraft versions, and the newest ones will have a badge next to them showcasing if they are Geyser compatible or not

### Enabling Geyser (for Bedrock Support)

1. Select a Geyser compatible version
2. Enable Geyser so that Bedrock players can connect.
3. Now you should see two more toggle options appear
   1. it's recommend to keep floodgate on as this allows the bedrock players to not need a java account
   2. And the second option is an experimental resource pack which enhances the experience for bedrock users

### Finish Setup

1. Once you’re done, simply close the versions menu.
2. Then finish setting up the server as usual.
3. When the server starts up, you’ll notice a Bedrock IP displayed alongside your regular server details.

### Invite Friends

Share the Bedrock IP with your friends who play on Bedrock Edition.\
They can now join your Paper server directly!&#x20;
